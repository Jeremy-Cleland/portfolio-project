I developed effective leadership skills and learned the importance of integrity, self-awareness, confidence, humility, accountability, and the ability to make crucial decisions in high-stress and low-stress environments during my time as a Green Beret. I am committed to joining a team and utilizing my experience to develop creative, market-competitive software that will benefit the organization.",
